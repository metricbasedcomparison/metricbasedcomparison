# Scripts and list of subject libraries, as part of our work in "Library Shopping: Using Metric Data to Compare Software Libraries"

This repository contains the list of subject libraries and scripts that were used to obtain metric data, as part of our work in the paper "Library Shopping: Using Metric Data to Compare Software Libraries"

You will find a folder with each of the scripts. Each file contains a description on how to run the script. All scripts were developed using Python 3.

For libraries whose issue tracking systems are on jira, please refer to the JIRA folder.

Note: Since we did not write the original version of the code that obtains the Backwards Compatibility metric, please contact laertexavier@dcc.ufmg.br, as he is the author of the original code.
