# Suplementary material for our work in "An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons of Software Libraries"

This repository contains the list of subject libraries, metric data for subject libraries, screenshots of the metric-based comparisons, and scripts that were used to obtain metric data, as part of our work in the paper "An Empirical Study of Metric-based Comparisons
of Software Libraries". The contents of this repository are the following:

* The list of subject libraries can be found in the file "List of Final Subject Java Libraries.xlsx"

* The ComparisonScreenshots folder contains a screenshot of the metric-based comparison of each of our 10 subject domains, as participants of our survey saw it in our website.

* The SurveyData folder contains individual plots for the ratings of each of our 9 metrics across the different domains. Additionally, the ClassifierComparison image provides a comparison of the different classification algorithms that we tried, and the MostSelectedLibraries image shows a table with the most selected libraries by participants per domain.

* The metric data that we extracted for our subject libraries can be found in the file "Metric Data for Subject Libraries.xlsx". The metric data was extracted in the month of January, 2018.

* The LibraryMetricScripts folder contains a script for each of our 9 metrics presented in our paper. Each file contains a description on how to run the script. All scripts were developed using Python 3. For libraries whose issue tracking systems are on jira, please refer to the JIRA folder.

Note: Since we did not write the original version of the code that obtains the Backwards Compatibility metric, we cannot upload its code here. The code has been kindly provided to us by Laerte Xavier. Please contact laertexavier@dcc.ufmg.br for more information.
