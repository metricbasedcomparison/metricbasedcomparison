# Scripts and list of subject libraries, as part of our work in "Library Shopping: Using Metric Data to Compare Software Libraries"

This repository contains the list of subject libraries and scripts that were used to obtain metric data, as part of our work in the paper "Library Shopping: Using Metric Data to Compare Software Libraries"

The list of subject libraries can be found in the file "List of Final Subject Java Libraries.xlsx"
You will find a folder with each of the scripts. Each file contains a description on how to run the script. All scripts were developed using Python 3.

For libraries whose issue tracking systems are on jira, please refer to the JIRA folder.

Note: Since we did not write the original version of the code that obtains the Backwards Compatibility metric, we cannot upload its code here. The code has been kindly provided to us by Laerte Xavier. Please contact laertexavier@dcc.ufmg.br for more information.
